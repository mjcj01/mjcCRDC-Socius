To create the visuals, multiple steps are taken:

1. data_01.do file needs to be executed. This will generate state-level Corporal Punishment (CP) and Out-of-school (OOS)suspension rates in excel files for every year the data is available. 

2. socius_data_prep.R, located within the folder "R Scripts", needs to be executed.

3. The layouts and various figures can then be generated as needed using the other R codes in the folder "R Scripts". The file names correspond to the figure number in the text (e.g., Figure S2 in the supplemental text is figure_s2.r). The figure files can executed in any order as long as socious_data_prep.r has been executed first.
